This repository is an annual archive of my article on the most popular front-end frameworks. The HTML page is saved using [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) and can be viewed offline. All the data for framework popularity is pooled from the annual [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com/) survey.

*to be updated with more info & links to github pages of the frameworks themselves*
